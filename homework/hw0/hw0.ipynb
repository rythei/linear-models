You will likely find the notebooks on the [online book](https://rythei.github.io/linear-models/content/basic_linear_regression/visualizing_data.html) useful. The goal of this assignment is primarily to 1) verify that you can open and run jupyter notebooks and 2) that you can access and submit assignments on the course [Gradescope](https://gradescope.com).\n",
