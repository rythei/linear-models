    "# Hypothesis testing for the Gaussian model\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will show that, under the assumption that the Gaussian model is true, we can perform various forms of statistical inference on a fitted linear regression model. In particular, in this section, we will focus on performing hypothesis testing on the coefficients $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}$, though the same ideas can be extended to do other forms of inference, such as obtaining confidence intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will derive two types of hypothesis tests:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A $t$-test for an individual coefficient $\\hat{\\beta}_j$, and\n",
    "2. An $F$-test for a subset of coefficients $\\hat{\\beta}_{j_1},\\dots,\\hat{\\beta}_{j_k}$.\n",

    "Recall that for the Gaussian model of linear regression, we assume that the responses $y_i$ are generated as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y_i = \\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\cdot \\boldsymbol{x}_i + \\varepsilon_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\varepsilon_i \\sim N(0,\\sigma^2)$. Under this assumption, we saw that the least squares coefficients $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} = (\\boldsymbol{X^\\top X})^{-1}\\boldsymbol{X^\\top y}$ be distributed as\n",

    "Again we obtain the same $p$-value as the `statsmodels` output (zero). This means that we have confidence, at any significance threshold, that at least one of the coefficients is different from zero. In some settings, this is verification that the model we are studying is non-trivial: we've found evidence that _some_ variable is a non-trivial predictor of the response. However, if we needed to find out which variables it is, we would need to return to our $t$-tests and provide the appropriate correction for testing multiple hypotheses.\n",

    "Of course, everything we've covered so far relies upon the fact that the Gaussian model is correct. This involves to assumptions (either of which failing to hold would make the tests derived here meangless): i) that the true model is actually linear, and ii) that the errors are normally distributed. Soon, we will introduce diagnostic tools that can be used to assess to what extent these assumptions actually appear to hold, which should always been used before interpreting the outputs of hypothesis tests.\n",
