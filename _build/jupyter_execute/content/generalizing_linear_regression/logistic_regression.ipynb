    "# GLMs part 1: logistic regression\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "So far in this course, we've covered methods for modeling a _continuous_ response variable $y\\in\\mathbb{R}$ as a linear function of features $\\boldsymbol{x}\\in\\mathbb{R}^p$ using the generic form\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y = \\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\cdot \\boldsymbol{x} + \\varepsilon.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We've also discussed extensions where the model can be non-linear in the features, provided it is linear in the parameters, i.e. a model of the form\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y = \\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\cdot \\phi(\\boldsymbol{x}) + \\varepsilon \\hspace{10mm} (1)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\phi$ is some pre-defined feature map. In this case, if $\\mathbb{E}[\\varepsilon] = 0$ and $\\mathbb{E}[\\varepsilon^2] = \\sigma^2$, then we get that \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}[y \\mid \\boldsymbol{x},\\boldsymbol{\\beta}] = \\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\cdot\\phi(\\boldsymbol{x})\\;\\;\\;\\; \\text{ and }\\;\\;\\;\\; \\text{Var}[y\\mid \\boldsymbol{x},\\boldsymbol{\\beta}] = \\sigma^2.\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when we assume $\\varepsilon \\sim N(0,\\sigma^2)$, we found that $y\\mid \\boldsymbol{x},\\boldsymbol{\\beta} \\sim N(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\cdot \\phi(\\boldsymbol{x}), \\sigma^2)$. This is often a natural model for a continuous response variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many practical situations, however, we may be interested in predicting a response variable which does not take on continuous values. For example, which might want to build a model to predict whether or not an individual will default on a loan, given a variety of attributes of the individual. In this case, $y\\in \\{\\text{default}, \\text{no default}\\}$. Or, we might want to estimate the number of calls a call center will recieve, given features like the time of day, whether, etc, in which case $y\\in \\{0,1,2,\\dots\\}$. In both of these cases, the reponse $y$ takes on discrete values, in which case the model $(1)$ is no longer suited to the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Generalized linear models_ (or GLMs) are a framework for modeling more general types of response variables. The step is to define a _link function_ $g$ such that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "g(\\mathbb{E}[y\\mid \\boldsymbol{x},\\boldsymbol{\\beta}]) = \\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\cdot \\boldsymbol{x}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that linear regression is just a special case of this where $g(z) = z$ is the identity function. Typically we will make certain assumptions about $g$, namely we will require that it is monotone and invertible, so that $g(a) = b \\iff a = g^{-1}(b)$. There will also be a natural correspondence between GLMs and the so-called exponential family of distributions, which we will discuss in more detail in a later notebook. For now, we will introduce the most widely used GLM, the logistic regression model, which can be used to model a binary response variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Logistic regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a prediction problem with a binary response variable $y\\in \\{0,1\\}$ (here we model the outcome as either 0 or 1, though you can think of these as encodings for whatever binary response we want, e.g. \"default\" vs \"no default\", \"dog\" vs \"cat\", etc.). In logistic regression, we directly model the probability of an observation being in either class using the _logistic function_:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}[y\\mid \\boldsymbol{x},\\boldsymbol{\\beta}] = P(y= 1\\mid \\boldsymbol{x},\\boldsymbol{\\beta}) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\cdot \\boldsymbol{x}}}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that this corresponds to our definition of a generalized linear model associated with the link function\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "g(z) = \\log\\left(\\frac{z}{1-z}\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "since\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "g(\\mathbb{E}[y\\mid \\boldsymbol{x},\\boldsymbol{\\beta}]) = \\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\cdot \\boldsymbol{x}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've defined the model, we need a method to actually fit the parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ given a set of data $(\\boldsymbol{x}_1,y_1),\\dots,(\\boldsymbol{x}_n,y_n)$. To do this, we will again use maximum likelihood estimation (similar to what we did for the [Gaussian model](../basic_linear_regression/maximum_likelihood_estimation.md)). For compactness, define $p_{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}(\\boldsymbol{x}) = P(Y=1\\mid \\boldsymbol{x},\\boldsymbol{\\beta})$. For an individual sample $(\\boldsymbol{x},y)$, the likelihood is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "L(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}; \\boldsymbol{x},y) = \\begin{cases} p_{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}(\\boldsymbol{x}) & \\text{if } y = 1\\\\ 1-p_{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}(\\boldsymbol{x}) & \\text{if } y=0 \\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This can concisely be written in a single expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "L(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}; \\boldsymbol{x},y) = p_{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}(\\boldsymbol{x})^{y}(1-p_{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}(\\boldsymbol{x}))^{1-y}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then if the $y_i$'s are conditionally independent given the $\\boldsymbol{x}_i$'s, the likelihood is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "L(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}; (\\boldsymbol{x}_i,y_i)_{i=1}^n) = \\prod_{i=1}^n  p_{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}(\\boldsymbol{x}_i)^{y_i}(1-p_{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}(\\boldsymbol{x}_i))^{1-y_i}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and hence the negative log likelihood (which we want to minimize) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\ell(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}) = -\\log L(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}; (\\boldsymbol{x}_i,y_i)_{i=1}^n) = -\\sum_{i=1}^n \\{y_i \\log p_{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}(\\boldsymbol{x}_i) + (1-y_i)\\log(1-p_{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}(\\boldsymbol{x}_i))\\}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the minimizer, we would like to find $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ such that $\\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}\\ell(\\boldsymbol{\\beta})=0$. With some calculus, we can calculate that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}\\ell(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}) = \\boldsymbol{X}^\\top (p_{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}(\\boldsymbol{X}) - \\boldsymbol{y})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $p_{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}(\\boldsymbol{X}) = \\begin{bmatrix}p_{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}(\\boldsymbol{x}_1) & \\cdots & p_{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}(\\boldsymbol{x}_n)\\end{bmatrix}$. Unfortunately, unlike in linear regression, setting this equal to zero does not give an analytical solution for $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$. Instead, we must use a numerical optimization algorithm to solve for the maximum likelihood estimator $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}$. Examples of these algorithms are gradient descent and Newton's method; we won't focus on the details of these techniques too much in this course, though we give a description of how Newton's method for logistic regression below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's work through an example with an actual dataset. For this, we will work with the well-known Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset. This dataset contains 30 different attributes for $n=569$ tumors, as well as a label indicating whether the tumor is malignant ($y=1$) or benign ($y=0$). Each feature is a different physical property of the tumor, e.g. radius, perimeter, area, etc.We load the data below."

Here, the data points $(\\boldsymbol{x}_i,y_i)_{i=1}^n$ could either be the data used to fit the model or a hold-out set of examples; these are often called the \"training error\" and \"validation error\", respectively. Let's evaluate the classification error for both the training and the hold-out sets. To do this, we first compute the fitted probabilities from the logistic regression model, and then treshold them at $t=1/2$ to obtain our predictions. We can use the built-in method for computing the prediction probabilties called `predict`, although it would be easy enough to do this ourselves using equation $(2)$."

    "\n",
    "However, the classification error itself is often not sufficient to adequately measure performance. A good example of this is when we have significant inbalance in the label distribution: suppose we have $m=100$ validation examples, $90$ of which have label $0$, and only $10$ of which have label $1$. Then the trivial classifier which always predicts $C(\\boldsymbol{x}) = 0$ regardless of the input will have only $10\\%$ classification error -- seemingly quite low -- even though the model hasn't actually used the data. Indeed, our dataset has inbalanced classes as well (though to a less dramatic extent), which we can check:"

    "The above table containing two rows and two columns is often called the _confusion matrix_ -- it captures the following quantities:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The number of _true positives_: examples which have true label $1$ which the model predicts as having label $1$\n",
    "- The number of _false positives_: example which have true label $0$ which the model (incorrectly) predicts as having label $1$\n",

    "\n",
    "From this matrix, we can compute things like the _false positive rate_ (FPR), the fraction of true negatives which are classified as positives or the _true postive rate_ (TPR) the fraction of true positives which are classifier as positives. We can then define the false negative rate as FNR=1-TPR, and the true negative rate as TNR=1-FPR. For example, for the trivial classifier $C(\\boldsymbol{x}) =0$ we described earlier, the true negative rate would be $0$ (which is good), but the false negative rate would be $1$ (which is very bad). \n",
    "\n",
    "To see the utility of these metrics more concretely, consider again the example of predicting whether a tumor is benign or malignant. In this case, we might be much more concerned with having a low false negative rate than we are about having a high false positive rate: we want to make sure that everyone who _does_ has a malignant tumor is captured, and less concerned if we incorrectly predict that some benign tumors are malignant (as this will be discovered via further tests). Let's compute the confusion matrix for the logistic regression model we fit earlier. Note that we compute these using the testing examples, _not_ the training examples. This allows us to get estimates for how the model will perform on new, unseen samples."

    "These rates all seem fine, but let's suppose that we wanted to be _really_ sure that we didn't have many false negatives -- say, a false negative rate of less than 1% (equivalently, to require the TPR to be greater than 99%). One way to achieve this is to change the threshold $t$ to something other than $1/2$. For example, suppose we set the threshold $t$ to be 0. Then, by definition of $C_t$, _every_ point would be classified as a positive example, and hence our FNR would be equal to $0$. Of course, this isn't a good idea as we will lose all discriminative power. However, perhaps some value between $0$ and $1/2$ would yield a favorable tradeoff between false positive and true positive rates. One way to visualize this tradeoff is by using a _reciever operating characteristic_ (or ROC) curve. The ROC curve is constructed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For a grid of $t$ values between $0$ and $1$, compute $\\text{FPR}(t)$ and $\\text{TPR}(t)$, the false positive and true positive rates of the classifier $C_t$.\n",
    "- Plot $\\text{FPR}(t)$ against $\\text{TPR}(t)$. \n",

    "This plot shows an increasing curve representing a tradeoff between false positives and true postives: as we get a larger true positive rate, we must also accept more false positives. For example, to get 99% TPR, we have to tolerate approximately a 20% false positive rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "How do we assess how \"good\" an ROC curve is? In the best case, we could get a 100% TPR with a 0% FPR. In this case, the ROC curve would just trace up the left axis across the top of the plot. In the worst case, we could have a random classifier, which randomly predicts either 0 or 1 for every datapoint. In this case, the ROC curve would look like the $y=x$ line in the $[0,1]\\times [0,1]$ box (visualized on the plot). This gives us an idea for how we can summarize an entire ROC curve: we can compute the _area under the ROC curve_ (called the AUC, or AU-ROC). The ideal classifier would have a score of $1$ under the metric (i.e. the area of the entire box), while the random classifier would have an AUC of $1/2$. The closer our AUC is to one, the more favorable the tradeoff between the TPR and FPR. We can estimate the AUC in python using the following."
