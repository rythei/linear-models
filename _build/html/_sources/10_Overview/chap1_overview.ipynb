    "# Linear Algebra for Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Stripped to its mathematical essentials, data science represents a blending of concepts from linear algebra, geometry, calculus, and probability theory.  Among these, linear algebra plays a crucial role, because the heart of any data analysis consists of one or multiple data matrices, and linear algebra is all about manipulating matrices. Hence, to learn or extract knowledge from data, a data scientist needs to have a working understanding of matrix and vector operations. But a data scientist also needs to know about data preparation and data cleaning as well as data visualization. A profound knowledge just about statistical modeling and inference is not sufficient for being a modern data scientist. In this course you will learn to understand the mechanics behind many tools that are used in data science by learning about linear algebra. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start at the beginning, with data. In order to learn from data, you need to collect some data (this can be a difficult and tedious job) or someone needs to give you some data. Typically, data are collect in the form of a table where the columns represent different variables of interest and the rows contain measurements for the subjects. Before you can start to ''manipulate'' or ''crunch'' your data, you need to read the raw data into your environment. In python, we can use the pandas library to do so."

    "It can be seen that the two vectors are not very close and this is somewhat plausible from a practical point of view, i.e., there is no reason to expect that there is a relationship between height and age.\n",
    "\n",
    "To further investiage the relationship between variables you can formulate linear regression model. For example, we might want to explore whether height and age impacts the weight of a person. You most likely have learned about linear regression models before, so we skip all the details here. Given a data frame you can estimate the parameters of a model and some other statistics using the statsmodel library."
