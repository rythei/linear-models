Then $(i,j)^{th}$ entry of $\\boldsymbol{A}$ is the $i$th coordinate of the vector $f(\\boldsymbol{e}_j)$, where $\\boldsymbol{e}_j$ is the $j^{th}$ standard basis vector. To see this, notice that\n",

    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a vector $\\boldsymbol{x}\\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, represented with respect to the standard basis $E$ as $\\boldsymbol{x} = (x_1,\\dots,x_n)$. We know that we can transform such a vector with a matrix $\\boldsymbol{A} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}$, representing a linear map from $\\mathbb{R}^n$ to $\\mathbb{R}^m$. Now suppose we chose to change basis, and represent $\\boldsymbol{x}$ with respect to a new basis $B = \\{\\boldsymbol{v}_1,\\dots, \\boldsymbol{v}_n\\}$ using the change of basis matrix $\\boldsymbol{T}_{E\\to B}$ to get the new coordinates $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha} = \\boldsymbol{T}_{E\\to B}\\boldsymbol{x}$. If we directly apply the matrix $A$ to the new coordinates $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$, we won't in general get the same result as if we applied it to the original vector $\\boldsymbol{x}$. This is because when we represent a linear map as a matrix, we are also implicitly doing so with a fixed basis. However, we will see in this section that we can also represent a linear map (i.e. a matrix) with respect to different bases.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see how this works, we will use a similar approach as in the previous section. Since $\\boldsymbol{A}$ is represented with respect to the standard basis, we need to pass it vectors represented with respect to this same basis. Therefore, a natural approach when trying to apply the linear map $\\boldsymbol{A}$ to vectors $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$ represented with respect to $B$ is to first transform $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$ to be in terms of the standard basis, using $\\boldsymbol{T}_{B\\to E}$, then apply the linear map $\\boldsymbol{A}$, and then finally tranform back to the basis $B$. In symbols, we apply the following linear map:\n",
