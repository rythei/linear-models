    "\n",
    "From our discussion on functions earlier in the semester, we know that functions may have left inverses, right inverses, or both, depending on whether the function is injective or surjective or both.\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, supposing that $f(\\boldsymbol{x}) = f(\\boldsymbol{y})$ is the same as supposing that $\\boldsymbol{x} - \\boldsymbol{y}$ is a vector such that $\\boldsymbol{A}(\\boldsymbol{x}-\\boldsymbol{y}) = \\boldsymbol{0}$.\n",
    "What injectivity is saying is that this is only possible if $\\boldsymbol{x} - \\boldsymbol{y} = \\boldsymbol{0}.$\n",
    "In other words, $f(\\boldsymbol{x}) = \\boldsymbol{Ax}$ is injective if and only if the only vector that $\\boldsymbol{A}$ maps to zero is the zero vector.\n",
